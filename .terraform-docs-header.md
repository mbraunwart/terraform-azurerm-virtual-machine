# Azure Enterprise Virtual Machine Module

This Terraform module provides an enterprise-ready framework for deploying and managing Azure Virtual Machines with built-in monitoring, diagnostics, and security features. It supports both Windows and Linux workloads while maintaining consistent deployment patterns and operational excellence.

## Purpose

The module simplifies VM provisioning by incorporating enterprise best practices, security controls, and monitoring capabilities. It reduces the complexity of managing different OS types and ensures consistent deployment patterns across your Azure environment.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-OS Support**  
  Deploy either Windows or Linux VMs using the same module with consistent configuration patterns.

- **Enhanced Monitoring**  
  Built-in Azure Monitor Agent integration with configurable diagnostic settings for comprehensive monitoring.

- **Security Features**  
  System-assigned managed identities, secure password handling, and support for marketplace images with plans.

- **Network Integration**  
  Flexible networking options including private and public IP support.

## Implementation Details

The module implements a secure-by-default approach with managed identities and built-in monitoring. It handles the complexity of marketplace image deployments, including automatic acceptance of terms and conditions. The implementation supports both password-based authentication with secure password handling.

### Architecture Overview

Each VM deployment includes:
- Network Interface with configurable IP settings
- OS Disk with customizable size and type
- System-assigned managed identity
- Azure Monitor Agent (optional)
- Diagnostic settings integration
- Boot diagnostics

### Best Practices

- Use strong passwords and consider rotating them regularly
- Enable Azure Monitor Agent for comprehensive monitoring
- Configure appropriate diagnostic settings based on operational requirements
- Tag resources appropriately for cost allocation and management
- Regular OS and security patches through Azure Update Management

## Diagnostic Settings

The module supports comprehensive monitoring through:
- Azure Monitor Agent for both Windows and Linux
- Performance counters for CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
- Windows Event logs or Linux Syslog collection
- Integration with Log Analytics workspace

## Known Limitations

- OS disk encryption at rest uses platform-managed keys
- Custom script extensions are not directly supported
- Only password authentication is supported (no SSH keys)
- Single network interface per VM

## Usage Example

```hcl
